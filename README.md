# Laravelchatwcm17
Thesis project by Mika Lehtinen


A simple Laravel/Vue Chat-application. It is a basic free-for-all chat room which provides the nessecary interface and functionality in order to chat in an open enviroument together with others. The application is powered by Pusher https://pusher.com/


Emojis and a "who's online-list" is implemented aswell. Account registration is disabled for security reasons as there's yet no way to ban/delete users other than through tinker commands.
